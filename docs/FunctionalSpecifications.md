## Background
  Brusselators are models for reactions that produce a catalyst for the same reaction, i.e. autocatalytic reactions. This includes the clock reaction, or the Belousovâ€“Zhabotinsky reaction (BZ reaction). 
  This is a popular reaction for demonstrations as the potassium bromate, malonic acid, and manganese sulfate prepared in a heated solution of sulfuric acid produce an engaging psychedelic pattern. 
  However, this reaction can be difficult to demonstrate in some settings due to the need for proper safety equipment to handle the strong acids involved. 

  This program provides a method of demonstrating the reaction without needing chemistry supplies. 
## User Profile
<ul>
  <li> <b> Teachers </b> - The primary user of the program are expected to be teachers. These users require engaging visuals for the program to be worth running for their class. They are expected to understanding the underlying equations and potentially have some understanding of python. 
  </li>
  <li>
    <b> Enthusiasts </b> - Users who wish to interact with the brusselator reaction in the comfort of their own home. These users are not expected to know python or the underlying chemical reactions. 
  </li>
</ul>

## Use Cases 
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Educational Use </b> - In a classroom, this software replace the more risky chemical reactions or be used to supplement the demonstration. To aid their presentation, these teachers may want to adjust the reaction rates beyond what are normally found.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Recreational Use </b> - At home, this software can be used to visualize brusselators through a simple GUI. This software will be an independent package that will not require a python installation.
